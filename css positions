Explanations and code examples for each CSS position:

  Static Position:
        The default position value.
        Elements with position: static; are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
        They are not affected by top, bottom, left, or right properties.


<style>
  .static-box {
    position: static;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: red;
  }
</style>

<div class="static-box"></div>


Relative Position:

    Elements with position: relative; are positioned relative to their normal position.
    They can be moved using the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

Example:

<style>
  .relative-box {
    position: relative;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: blue;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
  }
</style>

<div class="relative-box"></div>


Absolute Position:

    Elements with position: absolute; are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.
    If no positioned ancestor exists, they are positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the document body).

Example:

<style>
  .parent {
    position: relative;
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  
  .absolute-box {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: green;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
  }
</style>

<div class="parent">
  <div class="absolute-box"></div>
</div>


Fixed Position:

    Elements with position: fixed; are positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window).
    They stay fixed in their position even when the page is scrolled.

Example:
<style>
  .fixed-box {
    position: fixed;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: orange;
    top: 20px;
    right: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="fixed-box"></div>


Sticky Position:

    Elements with position: sticky; are positioned based on the user's scroll position.
    They behave like position: relative; until a specified threshold is met, then they become position: fixed; until the user scrolls back to the threshold.

Example:

<style>
  .sticky-box {
    position: sticky;
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: purple;
    top: 20px;
  }
</style>

<div class="sticky-box"></div>
